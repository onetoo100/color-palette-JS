# color-palette-JS
A simple color palette created using only Javascript.

created a simple project made only with javascript, a color palette where you can choose with normal or hexadecimal colors.
When you click on one of these buttons, the colors change and the color's name appears on the screen.
I used some css, to make the title and buttons responsive, the textarea where the colors appear I created from the DOM.
